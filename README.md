# Face-Emotion-Recognition

## Objective
Use face emotion recognition dataset to recognize the emotions from a live video feed or from a pre recorded video.

## Plan Of Action

### Install below requisites:
1) OpenCV
2) Keras with Tensorflow as backend
3) Numpy

### Get the data
In order to download the dataset, follow the URL https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013 and download the dataset.

### Preprocess the data and Train the model
Run the file face_emotion_recognition_training_model.py to train the neural network

### Test the model
Run the file face_emotion_recognition_test_model.py to train the neural network

## Conclusion
Accomplished emotion recognition on a live video feed
