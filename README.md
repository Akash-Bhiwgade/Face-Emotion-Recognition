# Face-Emotion-Recognition

## Objective
    Use face emotion recognition dataset to recognize the emotions from a live video feed 
    or from a pre recorded video.

## Plan Of Action
    Our plan of action is a 4 step process as below

### 1) Install below requisites:
    a) OpenCV
    b) Keras with Tensorflow as backend
    c) Numpy

### 2) Get the data
    In order to download the dataset, follow the URL https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013 
    and download the dataset.

### 3) Preprocess the data and Train the model
    Run the file face_emotion_recognition_training_model.py to train the neural network

### 4) Test the model
    Run the file face_emotion_recognition_test_model.py to train the neural network

## Conclusion
    Accomplished emotion recognition on a live video feed
